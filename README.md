Hangar
================
**This version of Hangar is outdated!**

There is a new, work-in-progress re-write updated for newer versions of Android. It's in the process of reaching feature parity and at the moment is only available on github. See here: https://github.com/mimicmobile/hangar
===

Hangar is an Android app that provides easy, relevant shortcuts in your notification drawer to your most used and relied upon apps.

This lightweight notification bar gives you convenient access to these apps from anywhere in Android while intelligently updating the priority and order of the shortcuts based on your daily use.

With the new pinned apps feature, favorite apps can be pinned alongside the ones Hangar has set.  Want a fresh look on those shortcuts?  Hangar now supports custom icons, letting you set a stylized theme by installing one of the many gorgeous icon packs available on the Play Store.

Hangar also keeps track of app usage statistics and includes 2 highly customizable widgets.

FAQ
================

**Q: How do I pin apps or select specific apps to appear in Hangar?**  
In Hangar go to Settings => Apps, select an app and "Pin app" from the menu.

**Q: How do I customize the icons Hangar displays?**  
You can apply an icon pack by selecting "Icon pack" in Settings => Appearance.  You can also manually adjust each app's icon in Settings => Apps by selecting an app and choosing "Change icon".

**Q: How do I remove the statusbar icon?**  
You can change the position in the Settings => Behavior screen. If you select the bottom position, the icon goes away!  One limitation of Android 4.4 and older is that on-going notifications require a notification icon in order to have TOP_PRIORITY as a notification.  As a workaround, there are a number of icon choices (Settings => Appearance) which includes a Transparent icon.  That icon creates a transparent gap, of course, but it's the best you can do without lowering the priority.

On Android L however you can have notifications set to display on the bottom and manually give them priority. This is done by longpressing the notification itself and manually toggling *Priority* in the settings page.

**Q: I can't install Hangar in my country!**  
This is caused by Google limiting in-app purchase apps (which Hangar uses for donations) to exclude certain countries.  However, since Hangar is open source, you can always install it via F-Droid. F-Droid is an open source app store that will automatically notify you and let you automatically install new versions when they come out. Go grab F-droid here: https://f-droid.org and download the app here: https://f-droid.org/packages/ca.mimic.apphangar/

**Q: Will Hangar drain my battery?**  
No!  It uses very little memory and very little CPU. It also only runs while your phone is awake and does not hold wakelock.

**Q: Can I have the recency weight and in-app use stats last a week/month/6mos/etc?**  
Right now time is added forever. This is one of the highest priority features and will be coming in the near future.
